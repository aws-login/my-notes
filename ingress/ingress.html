<h1>What is Ingress?</h1>

<p>Ingress is used to expose the website to the world.</p>

<h2>Why do we use Ingress?</h2>

<p>Ingress is used as a load balancer. Though we have a load balancer service, we use Ingress because it is cost-effective and intelligently routes traffic to requested services.</p>

<h2>What is a Load Balancer Service?</h2>

<p>A load balancer service routes traffic in a round-robin basis to specific services. For example, a service dedicated to hosting images will receive image-related requests.</p>

<h2>Why use Ingress if we have a Load Balancer?</h2>

<p>We use Ingress because standard load balancer services in Kubernetes lack enterprise-level features found in tools like nginx or F5, such as advanced routing and SSL termination.</p>

<p>An Ingress may be configured to provide externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL/TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting.</p>

<p>Ingress uses an Ingress Controller.</p>
