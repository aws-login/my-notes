<h1>Kube Scheduler</h1>

<p>Schedular only decides which pod goes to which nodes.</p>
<p>Scheduler actually does not place POD to nodes , its the responsible of KUBELET(as kubelet is captain of ship/ nodes, who creates the pod in nodes).</p>
<p>Scheduler only decided which pod goes where means which node.</p>
<p>Pods are of different size and configuration and schedular checks each nodes and assign the nodes as per requirements.</p>

<p><strong>How scheduler assign a node:</strong></p>
<p>Request reached to Scheduler to assign node to newly created Pod.</p>
<img src="ks1.JPG" alt="ks1">
<p>It filters the nodes have free resource free as per resource requiremnets.</p>
<img src="ks2.JPG" alt="ks2">
<p>Then it rank nodes as per nodes free resource and which have more resource will be put in high rank</p>
<img src="ks3.JPG" alt="ks3">
<p>And is highest ranked is select to put the pod</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>Scheduler can works that way that we can also customize the scheduler we want it to be work to schedule a pod on nodes.</p>
