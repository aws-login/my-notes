<h1>Kube controller Manager with Node Controller</h1>

<p><strong>Kube Controller Manager:</strong></p>
<p>Controller is a process that continuously monitor the state of components with the syste m and bringing the whole system.</p>

<p>These are bundles in Kubernetes are KUBE-COTROLLER-MANAGER.</p>

<p><strong>NODE CONTROLLER:</strong></p>
<p>Like Node controller is responsible for  monitoring the status of nodes , and take necessary action keep the application running.</p>
<p>Node controller checks the status for nodes availibilty in every 5 secs.</p>
<p>if it stop receiving heartbeat from the nodes, the nodes marked as unreachable but before marking it unreachable it waits from 40sec.</p>
<p>Once the controller marked the node as unreachable , controller will wait fr 5 mins to come up the node online. If node doesn't come up in 5 mins controller removed the pods on faulty node and provision them in  working nodes if they are part of repicasets.</p>

<p><strong>REPLICATION CONTROLLER:</strong></p>
<p> it is responsible to monitor the replica sets and ensure that desired number of pod are available all the time even its just one or hundred.</p>
<p>if a pod dies it creates another one.</p>

<p><strong>REPLICATION CONTROLLER provide few features:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>High availability :</strong>
  <p>If any pod dies by any reason , it will create another pod so same specification without a down time to application.</p>
  <p>Replication controller is effective on single pod or multiple pods.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Load Balancing and scaling:</strong>
  <p>Replication controller help in load balancing and scaling the application pods..</p>
  <p>Let suppose we have one pod which is providing the application service to nuber of user , if suppose the user increases then to full fill all the user Replication controller will create new pods to service users by scailing the pods without any application downs time.</p>
  </li> 
</ul>

<p>Below image we can see all the controllers , we can customize it by monitoring all the components or by doing selective monitoring my rmove the components from  KUBE-COTROLLER-MANAGER.</p>
